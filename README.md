This repo is a collection of miscellaneous scripts and config files that I use and you can too if you want to.

## Distro-Installs
In this directory and its subdirectories scripts and configs for different Linux distributions are stored that may or may not be helpful for you.

## nvim
Neovim config files. Place them in the appropiate config path (e.g. `~/.config/nvim`) to use them. You can find further instructions in the directory.
